# CAKE-demo

CAKE (Control Access via Key Encryption) is a framework and tool for secure data sharing via IPFS and public blockchains with access control.

This repository contains the implementation of the demo paper of the CAKE approach described in "[CAKE: Sharing Slices of Confidential Data on Blockchain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04152)" and presented at the [CAiSEâ€™24 forum](https://cyprusconferences.org/caise2024/).
